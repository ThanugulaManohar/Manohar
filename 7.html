    Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[1][2] (born 2 October 1869) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who primarily worked in the Indian independence movement. He is known for his doctrine of nonviolent resistance (Satyagraha) and is often referred to as the "Father of the Nation" in India. Gandhi's efforts were instrumental in India gaining independence from British rule.
